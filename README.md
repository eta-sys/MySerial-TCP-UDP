Windows-based program to communicate over RS, TCP, UDP

MySerial can help you in develop and test of your devices. It offers to you Serial Port, TCP Client and Server, UDP Client and Server Channels.
MySerial can be downloaded from http://ftp.eta-sys.net/MySerial where actual version hosts.
Using it is very easy. No 'Help' required - just hover the mouse over the box you want and a brief message will appear.
You can send plane text, hex, files and files line by line. You are in able to set control chars sequence at row end. 
You can see all the data in hex, which is very helpful when some extra or missing unprintable chars present in a message.
You can capture your whole session to one text file and explore it when it is convenient for you.
As I use it for testing my mule-project (see mule_ESP8266 at GitHub) when opening a file it is set to recomend .ml files first.
