# MySerial TCP UDP
=======

   MySerial can help you in develop and test of your devices. It offers to you Serial Port, TCP Client and Server, UDP Client and Server Channels.
   MySerial can be downloaded from http://ftp.eta-sys.net/MySerial where actual version hosts. Using it is very easy. No 'Help' required - just hover the mouse over the box you want and a brief message will appear.
   You can send plane text, hex, files and files line by line. 
   You are in able to set control chars sequence at row end.
   You can see all the data in hex, which is very helpful when some extra or missing unprintable chars present in a message. You don't have to type your message 'in hex', but the whole dialogue will be presented 'in hex' in main ListBox.
   You can capture your whole session to one text file and explore it when it is convenient to you. Just right-click in main ListBox.
   You may use program as a RS protocol recorder, using both channels just Rx wires tied to data-line.
   To send a hex value 1A type '0x1a' including '..'. Note that when you put a control char to the end of your message, the delimiter you set (CR or CRLF) will be omitted!
      for example: AT'0x1a' will send hex "41 54 1A".
   To repeat an already send message, select appropriated TextBox to desired channel then use Up and Down Arrows to find it and press 'ENTER'.
  
   As I use it for testing my mul-project, when opening a file it is set to recommend .ml files first.
